<h2>Using multiple Tags to structure your blog</h2>
In the FrontMatter tags for the post can be defined using either a
comma separeted list or a YAML list. 

For reasons unknown it depends on the format whether these Tags are displayed
under the post or not.

Also it is unclear to me if these Tags have to be defined with an ampersand 
in the FrontMatter
